Intergate and Automate with DevOps Tools ( Main Agenda ) 
Flow of Git – GitHub – Jenkins & Docker

Let’s learn new technologies and automate the world. 
                                                              – Mentor Mr. Vimal Daga
Learn and implement in funny way!!
        Git (Local Repository)
        GitHub (Source Code Management with great features of Collaboration & Versioning)
        Jenkins (Build & Automate)
        Dockers (Containerization)
	Guys we aren’t preparing a project here. 
Learn & Implement a 2 minutes Maggi* in a Free Style Project*  in this COVID Hunger situation and avoid hunger.
We don’t know how to cook until we see the preparation manual of Maggi Cooking automation (Git, Github, Jenkins & Docker).
Idea: With a less manual intervention, automate the tasks – agile the project in rapid fast to get a container of Free style recipe Maggi to be served... This is going …भूख से बचें

Future is in hands of automation – Integrate to the real world for the Fantastic outputs.
How to prepare a Maggi? (Really Easyway – Less time)
How to automate the Process? (Realy Easyway with Mr. Vimal sir mentorship – Less time, gaining automation knowledge with WoW!! Factor.)
Let’s Start:
 Objective: 
Developer D1 will continuously develop the code (Funny Way Code=Noodles) to enhance the features.

Developer Team: Will individually enhance their codes (Sticky & Non Sticky Noodles) and merge once the code (recipe) has been finalized with D1 master.

Testing Team (Quality Assurance – Head Cook(Jenkins)): Will continuously do perform & run the fixes on the source code with test (Test of taste).




Production Setup (Customer In front of Dining Table): Showcase to world about the business & products with the final code (Flavored Maggie - Enjoy).

The Project will show us step by step in automation with Phase wise.
